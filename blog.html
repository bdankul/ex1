                    Of course, my favorite interface is my iPhone. My entire life depends and is possible because of this interface. It's how I keep track of my life, where I am in my life, and the people in my life. iPhones keep everyone constantly connected to the world through various connections to outside networks, and in that way iPhones become everyones television, newspaper, weather report, source of entertainment, and so much more.</p>
<p>In terms of design, it is a simple and easy to use interface on a sleek and minimally designed hardware. Apple started the craze for touch screen phones and the emergence of a visual language of icons. Apple took the mundane, numbers-and-words-only type of interface, and started a new standard of aesthetically pleasing and fun interface that stole the hearts of the world. Today, you could really say that most people (in “developed” societies, of course) own an iPhone or some kind of Apple product, if not, own almost all the products in their line of personal computers/interfaces. Apple’s interface design changed the face of technology and they continue to create new standards for the rest of the technological world. As they will continue to be innovators, I will continue to use/buy their interfaces.</p>
